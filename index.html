  <p>Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Paul Payton, I am a graduate of the University of Tennessee with a Bachelors of Science focused in Psychology.
        I am a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Incorporated, Kappa Chi Chapter. In my free time, I enjoy volunteering to coach youth sports, where I am able to serve as a mentor 
        , leader, and assist in instilling valuable lessons that translate to real life events.</p>
            <p>During my post college professional career, I gained immense knowledge of business operations and people management. I worked grocery retail management for the previous 8 years, 
            where I was the sole leader of a multimillion dollar business unit.
            </p>
        <p>Inside of my website, you will find my various projects which each contain valuable information and aspects that make me unique. Thinking outside the box while staying within the expected parameters
             leads to the beauty of creativity.That is one thought process that brought me back to computer programming; I am able to be my creative self while also having an impact on a larger audience.  </p>
